    "Sage needs full sun! Soil must drain well.",
    "The easiest and best way to start sage is from a small plant. Set the plants 2 feet apart.",
    "You can also sow seeds up to two weeks before the last frost date. (See local frost dates.) Plant the seeds/cuttings in well-drained soil 1 to 2 weeks before the last spring frost.",
    "For best growth, the soil should be between 60º and 70ºF.",
    "Plants should grow to be between 12 and 30 inches in height.",
    "In the garden, plant near rosemary, cabbage, and carrots, but keep sage away from cucumbers."

    "Stop harvesting in the fall so the plant can prepare for winter.",
    "It’s best to replace the plants every few years so they remain productive."
