    "Due to Brussels sprouts’ need for a long growing season, plant them with a fall or winter harvest in mind.\nIn regions with cold winters, where temperatures are regularly below freezing, start seeds indoors about 2–3 weeks before the last spring frost date for an early fall harvest.\nIn regions with mild winters, where temperatures are occasionally below freezing, start seeds outdoors in early to mid-summer for a mid-fall or early winter harvest. \nIn regions with warm winters, where temperatures are rarely or never below freezing, start seeds outdoors in late summer for a mid- to late winter harvest.",
    "In regions with cold winters, where temperatures are regularly below freezing, start seeds indoors about 2–3 weeks before the last spring frost date for an early fall harvest.",
    "In regions with mild winters, where temperatures are occasionally below freezing, start seeds outdoors in early to mid-summer for a mid-fall or early winter harvest.",
    "In regions with warm winters, where temperatures are rarely or never below freezing, start seeds outdoors in late summer for a mid- to late winter harvest.",
    "Another way to determine planting time is to count backwards from your first fall frost date. Direct sow seeds into the garden about 4 months before the first fall frost. (See local frost dates.)",
    "Raised beds are especially recommended for cold-season vegetables, especially when seasons are changing and temps are not consistent.",
    "Work fertilizer into soil a few days before planting or transplanting.",
    "Plant transplanted seedlings 12–24 inches apart.",
    "If direct sowing seeds, plant ½ inch deep and 2–3 inches apart. Thin plants to 12–24 inches apart when they reach 6 inches tall.",
    "Water well at time of planting/transplanting."
  ],
  "care": [
    "Fertilize three weeks after transplanting.",
    "Mulch to retain moisture and keep the soil temperature cool.",
    "If growing during hot weather, be sure to keep the plants well watered.",
    "Do not disturb the soil around the plants; roots are shallow and susceptible to damage."

    "Protect the plant by mulching with straw or providing a cover if you plan to harvest into the winter."
